//Bitwise and Bit Shift Operator
// | Bitwise inclusive OR // Compares each bit of its first operand to the corresponding bit of
// its second operand. If either bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise,
// it is set to 0.

// ^ Bitwise exlusive OR // Compares each bit of its first operand to the corresponding bit of its
// second operand. If the bits are different, the corresponding result bit is set to 1.
// If the bits are the same, the result bit is set to 0.

// & Bitwise AND // Compares each bit of its first operand to the corresponding
// bit of its second operand. If both bits are 1,
// the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, it is set to 0.

/// Unsigned right shift // Shifts the bits of the first operand to the right by the number of
// positions specified by the second operand.

// Signed right shift
// Signed left shift
// ~ Unary bitwise complement // all the 0 bits become 1s, and all the 1 bits become 0s.

//Bitwise and Bit Shift Operator
// | Bitwise inclusive OR // Compares each bit of its first operand to the corresponding bit of
// its second operand. If either bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise,
// it is set to 0.
// ^ Bitwise exlusive OR
// & Bitwise AND
/// Unsigned right shift
// Signed right shift
// Signed left shift
// ~ Unary bitwise complement // all the 0 bits become 1s, and all the 1 bits become 0s.
